          <p>A business big enough that it could be listed on the NASDAQ goes belly up. Disappears! It ceases to exist without me. No, you clearly don't know who you're talking to, so let me clue you in. I am not in danger, Skyler. I AM the danger! A guy opens his door and gets shot and you think that of me? No. I am the one who knocks! </p>

          <p>Look, let's crunch some numbers. How much money are we laundering? Yeah, apparently. All right, $16,000 laundered at 75 cents on the dollar, minus my fee, which is 17%, comes out to $9,960. Congratulations, you've just left your family a second hand Subaru. </p>

          <p>Goodbye, Walter.  I don't owe you a damn thing.  All of this -- falling apart like this -- is on YOU.  We had a good thing, you stupid son of a bitch!  We had Fring.  We had a lab.  We had everything we needed and it all ran like clockwork.  You could've shut your mouth, cooked, and made as much money as you ever needed.  It was perfect.  But no!  You just had to blow it up.  YOU!  And your pride and your ego.  You just had to be the man.  If you'd done your job, known your place, we'd all be fine right now. </p>
